# Growth-Rate-Optimization
Maximizing monthly logarithmic growth rates using 3 assets

For each asset a distribution is estimated and also transformed into a uniform. Then taking each uniform distribution is used to fit a copula to do a Monte Carlo simulation of the correlated assets. Then taking the simulated assets mathematically the optimal percentages needed to maximized monthly logarithimc growth rate are found.
